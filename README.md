# Vibe Central - Nirav's Project Portfolio

## Welcome to my personal web development portfolio where you can learn more about me and the projects I have built along my full stack journey.

[Cruise to the Landing Page](https://nirav-v.github.io/vibe_central/)

 You can navigate between pages for a short bio/AboutMe section, projects portfolio, contact info with a form to send an email directly from the page, and a section to view technical skills and download my resume.

My portfolio is a single-page application built with React along with the Bootstrap and Material UI component libraries. It uses the [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/tutorial/overview/) API that links to my gmail account without having to set up a server. This gives you the option of sending me an email directly by filling out the form on the contact page.
