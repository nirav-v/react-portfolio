          I am a full stack web developer residing in San Diego, CA. I am
          fascinated by how the web works, and am passionate about ensuring the
          best possible user experience in every project that I am involved
          with. Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors, animals, and
          skateboarding. I continue to weave these interests of mine into the
          projects I showcase in this portfolio.
